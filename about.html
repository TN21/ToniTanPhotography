                <h1>About</h1>
                     <p>Hello你好, This is Toni Tan. Welcome to the world inside my eyes. I am Chinese born Kansas City photographer.
                        I am also a student in UMKC major in Computer Science and minor in Studio Art. 
                        In the past 22 years, I have been self-taught in photography and Photoshop.
                        Until I began attended UMKC in 2018, that’s when I had my first photography class.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My grandma does oil painting and my mom does hand drawing. I guess I was influenced by them. 
                        But growing up in a traditional Chinese family, I can only have art as my hobby. 
                        When I was little, I was set to be a doctor, engineer, lawyer, nurse or teacher. However, art gave me unlimited power to explore the things I love. 
                        So, I am here to present the world through my camera. </p>

                <h1>Artist's Statement</h1>
                    <p>About fifteen years ago, I was on the way home from a trip with my parents in a small town in China. 
                        My dad was taking photos for me and my mom when we were standing in front of the Union Station. 
                        An old man was walking toward us. A girl was on the one side of him and supported the old man with one hand. 
                        She asked my dad if he is a photographer and she wants a photograph with her dad. 
                        Her dad never had a photo before in his life. Unfortunately, my dad wasn’t a photographer, and there weren’t any modern commutation tool like now. 
                        I clearly remember the moment when they walked away with disappointing and sadness. 
                        Until today, My mom still always told me that she felt regret about it. 
                        We could ask their address and mail to them after the photo printed out. Fifteen years later, I became a photographer. 
                        I understand that not everyone can afford a photo shot, especially a professional portrait. 
                        Therefore, the goal of my photography career is to keep the cost as low as possible and as professional as possible. 
                        I want everyone having a chance to capture the moment and make it last forever.</p>
